# Summary

This introductory course is divided in 3 sessions, each one of 2 hours.
The objective is to show how to use R/Rstudio. At the end of the course,
you should be able to understand this software and use it to read,
transform and visualize data. The basis of how to use R are presented
here, but more extensives resources are available in internet and books.

# Why R?
R is a widely used statistical program in science: biology, mathematics, social sciences, chemistry... The main reasons could be:
1)   Free software
2)  Open-source
3)  Multi-platform (Windows, Mac and Linux)
4)  A huge community of users
5)  Reproducibility


# And RStudio? What is it?
R can be a bit difficult to understand if you do not have any programming experience. 
RStudio is a complementary software that allows an easier way to work with R. How? Integrating a graphical user interface in 4 panes:

1)  Source editor. A pane where you can write, modify and save scripts or other text files. Think of it like a notepad.
2)  Console. This pane is where R works: the command line. R will process the commands you write.
3)  Environment / History. A pane with differents tabs. The environment tab is where you can see all data stored in your work session. The history tab register all commands used in the console pane.
4)  Files, plots, packages and help. Another multitab pane whith a file manager (Files), a pane to see the plots you created (Plots), the installed packages (Packages) and the R documentation (Help)

# Installing R and RStudio
R has to be installed before Rstudio. If you're in Spain, go to this website: [https://cran.rediris.es/](https://cran.rediris.es/). Install the last version of R for your operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS...). When R is fully installed, you can download RStudio from this website: [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Choose the download file necessary for your operating system, as you did for R. Easy peasy.
